Hi, I'm Panashe. I help early stage startups in New York City keep their business goals in sync with their technology, so they can move faster with high quality.

Before this, I was an engineer at Dropbox for 7.5 years.
Here are some of the highlights of my tenure:

- Implemented compliance framework for EU youth privacy regulations
  across client platforms as the technical lead for Dropbox Family (impact of €20M-€80M saved)
- Developed multi-stage data recovery procedures and forensic investigation
  processes for critical data integrity incidents (saved 9M+ accidentally
  deleted user files)
- Co-inventor on 3 published and 1 pending US patent

I was born and raised in [Harare, Zimbabwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harare). I live in Brooklyn, NY with my wife and our lovely daughter.
